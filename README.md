ðŸ“Š Project Overview
The Zomato Restaurants Analysis Dashboard provides an end-to-end business intelligence solution built using Power BI.
The project focuses on understanding Zomatoâ€™s global restaurant data â€” analyzing restaurant performance, cuisines, customer engagement, and regional distribution.
By transforming raw data into meaningful visuals, the dashboard enables stakeholders to make data-driven business decisions in the restaurant industry.

ðŸ§© Data Modeling Process:-
After data cleaning, a structured star schema model was created to enhance analytical efficiency and reduce redundancy.
Model Design:
Fact Table:
Restaurant_Fact â€“ Contains metrics such as Votes, Average Rating, Online Delivery, and Table Booking.
Dimension Tables:
Country_Dim â€“ Country and region information
City_Dim â€“ City-level details
Cuisine_Dim â€“ Cuisine categories
Date_Dim â€“ Date, Year, Quarter, and Month hierarchy
Relationships Established:
Restaurant_Fact[CountryID] â†’ Country_Dim[CountryID]
Restaurant_Fact[CityID] â†’ City_Dim[CityID]
Restaurant_Fact[CuisineID] â†’ Cuisine_Dim[CuisineID]
Restaurant_Fact[DateKey] â†’ Date_Dim[DateKey]
Calculated Measures (DAX):
Total Votes = SUM(Restaurant_Fact[Votes])
Total Restaurants = COUNT(Restaurant_Fact[RestaurantID])
Average Rating = AVERAGE(Restaurant_Fact[Rating])
Online Delivery % = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Restaurant_Fact), Restaurant_Fact[OnlineDelivery] = "Yes"), COUNTROWS(Restaurant_Fact))
Table Booking % = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Restaurant_Fact), Restaurant_Fact[TableBooking] = "Yes"), COUNTROWS(Restaurant_Fact))
This model allowed dynamic filtering and drilling down by city, cuisine, or year.
The Power BI dashboard includes interactive visuals, filters, and KPIs to present clear insights:

Combo Chart: (Cuisines vs Ratings)	shows how cuisines perform based on average ratings
Horizontal Bar Chart: (Cuisine-wise)	represents the restaurant count per cuisine type
Donut Charts: Visualize the proportion of restaurants offering Online Delivery and Table Booking
Filters/Slicers: Allow filtering by Year and Country to explore trends interactively.
